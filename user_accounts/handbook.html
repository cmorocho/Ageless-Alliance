                                    <div class="cd-handbook-content">
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">Here are some guidelines that will help:</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">1) <strong>Be Genuine</strong> - be yourself! Aside
                                        from modifications in behavior to assure the comfort of the participant, i.e. questions, less talking and more listening,
                                        conscious attentiveness, etc. the volunteer should relate the same "personality" he/she displays in any other situation.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">2) <strong>Communication</strong> - the volunteer supervision. The importance of clear communication between volunteer
                                        supervision and volunteers cannot be overemphasized. The two of you are a mini-team and can be of great help to one another
                                        by maintaining regular contact and keeping one another current on what is going on.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">3) <strong>Dependability</strong> -
                                        never offer more than you can deliver. To people in crisis, whose lives are subject to so much unpredictability, it is essential
                                        to know that they can count on someone or something.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">4) <strong>Be Accommodating</strong> - meet them where they are! Over
                                        and over again in your training, the concept of tuning in to the elder and meeting them in terms of their own values and life patterns
                                        is stressed.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">5) <strong>Little Things Mean a Lot!</strong></p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Your personal grooming and manor of dress can affect an elder's mood.</li>
                                            <li>Perfume or strong after-shave can be most unpleasant and many people have allergies or respiratory issues.</li>
                                            <li>A positive attitude and pleasant expression means a lot.</li>
                                            <li>Sometimes not talking, but sitting with a a person and letting him or her know you care by being there is the greatest gift of all.</li>

                                            Alliance’s elders. The advocate’s role is to provide a source of support and companionship for

                                            elders who have nowhere else to turn. Therefore, an advocate’s responsibilities will vary

                                            depending on the needs of the individual elder. An advocate may be called upon to do

                                            anything from keeping the elder company in his or her home to transporting the elder to a

                                            doctor’s appointment. The advocate may also be asked to utilize their skills and training, as

                                            well as work with other volunteers to support the elder. Volunteers are expected to work

                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">All Ageless Alliance volunteers should observe professional ethics in their interactions with

                                            other volunteers and elders. All volunteers should strive to extend common courtesy and

                                            maintain a professional demeanor regardless of rank or position.

                                            Although we are staffed by volunteers, Ageless Alliance strives to create an environment that

                                            is highly professional. For this reason, conduct in violation of the policies below, or otherwise

                                        or taking on roles that should be filled by others.</li>

                                        <li>Sharing excessively about our personal lives. Some sharing can be helpful in building

                                        trust and rapport with the participant. Too much sharing can become uncomfortable or

                                        can leave the participant feeling burdened. It is important to ask yourself, “How will this

                                        information help the participant?”</li>

                                        <li>Breaking confidentiality. Take care with participant information, including refraining

                                        from talking about participants in public areas like restaurants or other public places.</li>

                                        <li>Looking to the client to meet our emotional needs. It is true that we often “receive

                                        back” from participants emotionally and feel that our time with them has been

                                        personally fulfilling. However, this fulfillment will not always be present and it is not the

                                        client’s responsibility to provide. Our relationships with participants are not equal or

                                        reciprocal. Rather, the Service Corps Team is focused on the participants’ needs and

                                        works to provide them with care and support.</li></ul><br><br>

                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">Poor boundaries can lead to frustration. When expectations are not clear and consistent,

                                        participants can feel let down or misled. We may feel tired and stretched beyond our limits.

                                        Conversely, appropriate boundaries help us to serve our participants effectively, allowing

                                        everyone to feel clear and comfortable in the relationship. We are able to do what we can

                                        <li>Stay near people who are moving about. Walking in lonely, isolated areas may

                                        you can use them as a method of self-defense. Hold the key ring in the palm of

                                        your hand and put one key between each of your four fingers with the sharp ends

                                        sticking out. You may want to attach a whistle on your key ring, which can be

                                        used to summon help.</li>

                                        <li>Walk confidently. Know where you are going. If you don’t, go to a store and ask

                                        or call for directions.</li></ul><br><br>

                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">1) Breathe in slowly and deeply.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">2) As you breathe out slowly, feel yourself beginning to relax. Feel the tension leaving your

                                            body.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">3) Now breathe in and out slowly and regularly, at whatever rate is comfortable for you.

                                            You may wish to try abdominal breathing.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">4) To help you focus on your breathing and to breathe slowly and rhythmically:</p>

                                            <ul><li>a. Breathe in as you say silently to yourself, “one, two, three.”</li>

                                            <li>b. Breathe out as you say silently to yourself, “one, two, three.”</li>

                                            <li>c. Or each time you breathe out, say silently to yourself a word such as “peace” or

                                            “relax.”</li></ul>

                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">6) End with a slow deep breath. As you breathe out say to yourself, “I feel alert and

                                            relaxed.”</p>

                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">Something may have happened to you a while ago that brought you peace and comfort. You

                                            may be able to draw on that past experience to bring you peace or comfort now. Think about

                                            these questions:</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">1) Can you remember any situation, even when you were a child, when you felt calm,

                                            peaceful, secure, hopeful, or comfortable?</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">2) Have you ever daydreamed about something peaceful? What were you thinking of?</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">3) Do you get a dreamy feeling when you listen to music? Do you have any favorite music?</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">4) Do you have any favorite poetry that you find uplifting or reassuring?</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">5) Have you ever been religiously active? Do you have favorite readings, hymns or prayers?

                                            Even if you haven’t heard or thought of them for many years, childhood religious

                                            experiences may still be very soothing.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px"><strong><u>Additional Points:</u></strong> Very likely some of the things you think of in answer to these questions can

                                            be recorded for you, such as your favorite music or a prayer. Then you can listen to the

                                            recording whenever you wish. Or, you can simply close your eyes and recall the events or

                                            words.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px"><strong><u>Exercise 3: Active Listening to Recorded Music</u></strong></p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">1) Choose music that you enjoy listening to. (Other options are comedy routines, sporting

                                            events, old radio shows or a stories that you enjoy listening to.)</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">2) Mark time to the music, e.g. tap out the rhythm with your finger or nod your head. This

                                            helps you concentrate on the music rather than your discomfort.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">3) Keep your eyes open and focus steadily on one stationary spot or object. If you wish to

                                            close your eyes, picture something about the music.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">4) Listen to the music at a comfortable volume. If the discomfort increases, try increasing

                                            the volume; decrease the volume when the discomfort decreases.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">5) If this is not effective enough, try adding or changing one or more of the following: try

                                            other music; mark time to the music in more than one manner, e.g. tap your foot and

                                            finger at the same time.</p>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px"><strong>Additional Points:</strong> Many people have found this technique to be helpful. It tends to be very

                                            popular, probably because the equipment is usually readily available and is a part of daily life.

                                            Other advantages are that it is easy to learn and is not physically or mentally demanding. If

                                            you are very tired, you many simply listen to the music and omit making time or focusing on a

                                            spot.</p>
